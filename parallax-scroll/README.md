# Parallax Scrolling with React + GSAP

This project demonstrates the implementation of parallax scrolling effects using React and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). It serves as a learning journey through various GSAP concepts and animation techniques.

## GSAP Concepts Covered

### 1. Basic Animations

- [x] Setting up GSAP in a React project
- [x] Basic tweening with `gsap.to()`, `gsap.from()`, and `gsap.set()`
- [x] Understanding animation properties (scale, opacity, position)

### 2. ScrollTrigger

- [x] Basic ScrollTrigger setup
- [x] Trigger points and scroll positions
- [x] Scrub effects for smooth animations
- [x] Pin-spacing and duration control

### 3. Responsive Design

- [x] Handling window resize events
- [x] Responsive font sizing
- [x] Mobile-friendly animations
- [x] Performance optimization

### 4. Advanced Features

- [x] Custom easing functions
- [x] Timeline management
- [x] Cleanup and memory management
- [x] Debug markers and testing
